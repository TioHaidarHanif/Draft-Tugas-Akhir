2. Only work on features that haven't been implemented yet
3. Follow the step-by-step development approach outlined in `/workspaces/Draft-Tugas-Akhir/context.md`
4. After completing each feature, create tests for it
5. Document all completed work in `/workspaces/Draft-Tugas-Akhir/progress.md` including:
   - What was implemented
