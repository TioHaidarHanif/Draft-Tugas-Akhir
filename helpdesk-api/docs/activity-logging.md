## Auth and User Activity Logging Feature (June 23, 2025)

### Features Implemented
- Created `activity_logs` table to track user activities
- Implemented `ActivityLogService` for logging different types of activities
- Added activity logging to auth processes (login, logout, registration)
- Added activity logging to user management (updates, role changes, deletions)
- Created admin-only endpoints for viewing activity logs

### Components Created

#### Database
- Created migration for `activity_logs` table with fields:
  - `id` (auto-increment)
  - `user_id` (foreign key to users table)
  - `activity` (string)
  - `description` (text)
  - `ip_address` (string)
  - `user_agent` (text)
  - `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps

#### Models
- Created `ActivityLog` model with:
  - Relationship to User model
  - Fillable fields for all log attributes

#### Services
- Created `ActivityLogService` with methods:
  - `log()` for general activity logging
  - `logAuth()` for authentication activities
  - `logProfile()` for profile-related activities
  - `logUserManagement()` for admin user management activities

#### Controllers
- Updated `AuthController` to log authentication events
- Updated `UserController` to log user management events
- Created `ActivityLogController` with:
  - `index()` method for listing logs with filtering
  - `show()` method for viewing specific log details
  - `statistics()` method for log analytics

#### Routes
- Added admin-only routes for activity logs:
  - GET `/api/activity-logs` - List all logs with optional filtering
  - GET `/api/activity-logs/statistics` - View log statistics
  - GET `/api/activity-logs/{id}` - View a specific log

#### Testing
- Created unit tests for `ActivityLogService`
- Created feature tests for `ActivityLogController`
- Added tests for authorization (only admin can access logs)

### Security Considerations
- All activity log endpoints are protected behind admin authorization
- User IP addresses and user agents are recorded for security auditing
- Activity type prefixes help categorize and filter logs

### Next Steps
- Consider implementing data retention policies for logs
- Add more granular logging for ticket-related activities
- Consider implementing more advanced analytics for user behavior
